For SBA 1, we used what we learned this week to practice version control. In my local repository, I created branches for features by using the "git checkout -b" to simultaneously make it the current working branch. There, I could add files for staging and commit changes. I used "git checkout" to switch between branches (without the "-b" flag), and merged other branches with "git merge". I also used "git branch" to check what branches have been made and which branch I am currently working on. When merge conflicts arose, I opened the conflicting file, fixed any conflicts, committed the changes, and finally used "git status" to ensure everything was resolved. In my case, a simulated merge caused two different footers to exist my index.html file, so I accepted an incoming change to remove one of them.

Afterwards, I created a pull request for my project on GitHub — I created a branch with its GUI called "review/main" and simulated wanting to add a README file. I then visited a peer's repository to interact with one of their pull requests, where they also simulated adding an additional footer. It seems GitHub has tools for letting you comment, approve, and request changes to these kinds of pull requests. It lets us review and give feedback on code before further action is taken. Having somebody catch something like that before it can get merged into the main branch also helps ensure code quality. Be it contributors accidentally changing the same line of code to errors in a function, I can see this being very useful when collaborating on bigger projects with a team!

I'll likely use GitHub for showcasing my projects going forward. It shows contribution activity and lets others help improve my code!
